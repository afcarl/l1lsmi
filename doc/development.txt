== Options keys ==
- v = Diagonal W's l1 regularization parameter 
- fold = number of folds to do in cross validation 
- sigmazfactor_list = list of candidates to be multiplied with pair-wise
  median distance of all Z_i, then used as the Gaussian width parameter for
  Z.
- sigmayfactor_list = list of candidates to to be multiplied with pair-wise
  median distance of all Y_i, then used as the Gaussian width parameter for
  Y. This is used only when Gaussian kernel is used on Y (regression
  problems).
- lsmilambda_list = list of candidates of LSMI's lambda
- seed = seed of randomness
- b = number of basis functions
- winitfunc = function to initialize W. f: m -> R^m. Return an
  m-dimensional vector for diagonal entries of W.
- usedeltakernel = If true, then Delta kernel is used on Y 
  (for classification problems).
- wpenaltyfunc = penalty function for W (typically an approximation of l1)
  (in undlsmi)
- wlearner =  wlearner = function which learns W. f: (X,Y,options) -> [W, fvalue].
- k = number of features to select
- wranker = function which returns a ranked list of m features. f: W ->
  rank_list. rank_list may have length less than m. See also WRanker class.
